# Black Magic Foundation Site

## Overview 
The Black Magic Foundation Site is a website developed by [Black Magic](https://heyblackmagic.com) with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) and other core technologies in order to create a standard approach to common components on every website. 

Of course, every development will be different and therefore it is possible that the components of this project will not fit 100% to your needs. However, the problem abstraction and thought pattern you will find in each solution is applicable and useful for any use case in the development of a Craft CMS component.  

At the same time, the Foundation Site is the standard accepted by the Black Magic development team after several years of experience successfully delivering numerous sites on Craft CMS.
